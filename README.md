### Hi there 👋 my name is Lisa Vanderschuit, pronouns are she/her. I’m a Senior Technical Program Manager at Shopify. 

Over my 8 years at Shopify, I have led more than 30 key initiatives, including some of the largest replatforming initiatives for our engineering org. 

The Office of the CTO at Shopify leverages program managers to ensure engineering's impact is greater than the sum of its parts. They do this by delivering initiatives that cut across many engineering groups which enable our product teams to build the best product for merchants. 

My passion for building communities has led me to work to co-found the Shopify Asian employee resource group, as well as the Engineering Program Management craft at Shopify.

⚡ Fun fact: I really don't like fruit salad. Apparently this is as controversal as pineapple on pizza 🍕
