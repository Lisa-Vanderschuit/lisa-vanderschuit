### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Lisa Vanderschuit, pronouns are she/her.Â Iâ€™m a Senior Technical Program Manager at Shopify.Â 

Over my 8 years at Shopify, I have led more than 30 key initiatives, including some of the largest replatforming initiatives for our engineering org.Â I ensure teams work together for our initiatives so we can build the best platform for merchants.
